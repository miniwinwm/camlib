# camlib

This repo contains the source code for the static libraries that the MiniWinCamera example projects use to drive a video camera. For the embedded examples this is an OV7670 camera module without a buffer. For the Windows/Linux examples it is the first camera found on the system. The Linux/Windows versions use OpenCV version 4.30. The camera installed on the system must be supported by this package.
